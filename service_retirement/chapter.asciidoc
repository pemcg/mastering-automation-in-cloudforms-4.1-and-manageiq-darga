== Service Retirement

We saw in link:../vm_instance_retirement/chapter.asciidoc[VM and Instance Retirement] how individual virtual machines or instances can be retired from their *Lifecycle* menu button, and we can also retire services in the same way. The service retirement process follows a similar workflow to the VM retirement process, but we have the flexibility to specify per-service retirement state machines if we wish.

=== Defining a Service Retirement Entry Point

When we create a service catalog item, we can optionally specify a retirement entry point (see <<i1>>).

If we specify our own retirement entry point, then this state machine will be used to retire any services created from this catalog item. If we do not specify our own entry point here then then the _Default_ retirement state machine will be used..

=== Initiating Retirement

Service retirement is initiated from the Lifecycle menu on the service details frame (see <<i2>>).

Clicking on *Retire this Service* raises a *request_service_retire* event that begins a chain of relationships through the datastore:

* *request_service_retire* ->
** _/System/Event/MiqEvent/POLICY/request_service_retire_ ->
** _/Service/Retirement/StateMachines/Methods/GetRetirementEntrypoint_ 

_GetRetirementEntrypoint_ runs a method _get_retirement_entry_point_ that returns the retirement entry point state machine defined when the service catalog item was created (see <<i3>>). If this is empty then _/Service/Retirement/StateMachines/ServiceRetirement/Default_ is returned.

=== Retirement-Related Attributes and Methods

A service object has a number of retirement-related methods:

----
$evm.root['service'].automate_retirement_entrypoint
$evm.root['service'].start_retirement
$evm.root['service'].finish_retirement
$evm.root['service'].retire_now
$evm.root['service'].retire_service_resources
$evm.root['service'].retiring?
$evm.root['service'].retired?
$evm.root['service'].error_retiring?
$evm.root['service'].retirement_state=
$evm.root['service'].retirement_warn=
$evm.root['service'].retires_on=
----

and attributes:

----
$evm.root['service'].retired = nil
$evm.root['service'].retirement_last_warn = nil
$evm.root['service'].retirement_requester = nil
$evm.root['service'].retirement_state = nil
$evm.root['service'].retirement_warn = nil
$evm.root['service'].retires_on = nil
----

=== Service Retirement State Machine

The _Default_ service retirement state machine is simpler than its VM counterpart (see <<i3>>)

==== StartRetirement

The _StartRetirement_ instance calls the _start_retirement_ state machine method, which checks whether the service is already in state _retired_ or _retiring_, and if so it aborts. If in neither of these states it calls the service's `start_retirement` method, which sets the `retirement_state` attribute to 'retiring'.

==== RetireService/CheckServiceRetired

The _RetireService_ instance calls the _retire_service_ state machine method, which in turn calls the service object's `retire_service_resources` method. This method calls the `retire_now` method of every VM comprising the service, to initiate their retirement. *CheckServiceRetired* retries the stage until all VMs are retired or deleted.

==== FinishRetirement

The *FinishRetirement* state sets the following Service object attributes:

----
:retires_on       => Date.today
:retired          => true
:retirement_state => "retired"
----

It also raises a *service_retired* event that can be caught by an Automate action or control policy.

==== DeleteServiceFromVMDB

The _DeleteServiceFromVMDB_ instance calls the _delete_service_from_vmdb_ state machine method, which removes the service record from the VMDB.

=== Summary

We have seen in this chapter how the process of retiring a service will also trigger the retirement of its virtual machines. If we are using service hierarchies however, or services to manage cloud-style workloads as single entities, this might not be our desired behaviour.

Fortunately the service retirement mechanism is flexible enough that we can create per-service retirement state machines that we can customise to suit our individual use cases and workloads.

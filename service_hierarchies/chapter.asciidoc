[[service-hierarchies]]
== Service Hierarchies

We have seen how service catalogs made up of catalog items and bundles can simplify the process of ordering infrastructure or cloud instance and virtual machines. Simplicity of ordering is not the only benefit of services however.

When we order one or more virtual machines from a service catalog, a new _service_ is created for us that appears in *All Services* in the WebUI. This service gives us a useful summary of its resources in the *Totals for Service VMs* section. We can use this feature to extend the utility of services into tracking and organising resources. We could, for example, use a service to represent a project comprising many dozens of virtual machines. We would be able to see the total virtual machine resource consumption for the entire project in a single place in the WebUI.

In line with this organisational use, we can arrange services in hierarchies for further convenience (see <<i1>>).

In this example we have three child services, representing the three tiers of our simple intranet platform. <<i2>> shows the single server making up the database tier of our architecture.

When we view the parent service, we see that it contains details of all child services, including the cumulative CPU, memory and disk counts (see <<i5>>).

=== Organising Our Services

To make maximum use of service hierarchies, it is useful to be able to create empty services, and to be able to move both services and VMs into existing services.

==== Creating an Empty Service

We could create a new service directly from automation, using the lines:

[source,ruby]
----
new_service = $evm.vmdb('service').create(:name => "My New Service")
new_service.display = true
----

For this example though, we'll create our new empty service from a service catalog.

===== State machine

First we'll copy _ManageIQ/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template/default_ into our own Domain, and rename it _EmptyService_. We'll add a *pre5* relationship to a new instance that we'll create, called __/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/Methods/rename_service__ (see <<i6>>).

[[i6]]
.Fields of the EmptyService state machine

{zwsp} +

===== Method

The *pre5* stage of this state machine is a relationship to a __rename_service__ instance. This instance calls a __rename_service__ method containing the following code:

[source,ruby]
----
begin
  service_template_provision_task = $evm.root['service_template_provision_task']
  service = service_template_provision_task.destination
  dialog_options = service_template_provision_task.dialog_options
  if dialog_options.has_key? 'dialog_service_name'
    service.name = "#{dialog_options['dialog_service_name']}"
  end
  if dialog_options.has_key? 'dialog_service_description'
    service.description = "#{dialog_options['dialog_service_description']}"
  end

  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'ok'
  exit MIQ_OK
rescue => err
  $evm.log(:error, "[#{err}]\n#{err.backtrace.join("\n")}")
  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'error'
  $evm.root['ae_reason'] = "Error: #{err.message}"
  exit MIQ_ERROR
end
----

===== Service dialog

We create a simple service dialog called "New Service" with element names *service_name* and **service_description** (see <<i7>>).

[[i7]]
.Service dialog
image::images/ss7.png[Screenshot,450,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

===== Putting it all together

Finally we assemble all of these parts by creating a new service catalog called **General Services**, a new catalog item of type **Generic** called _Empty Service_ (see <<i8>>).

[[i8]]
.The completed "Empty Service" service catalog item
image::images/ss8.png[Screenshot,550,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

We can order from this service catalog item to create our new empty services.

=== Adding VMs and Services to Existing Services

We'll provide the ability to move both services and virtual machines into existing services, from a button. The button will present a drop-down list of existing services that we can add as a new parent service (see <<i9>>).

[[i9]]
.Listing available services in a dynamic drop-down
image::images/ss9.png[Screenshot,450,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

==== Adding the Button

As before, the process of adding a button involves the creation of the button dialog, and a button script. For this example however our dialog will contain a dynamic drop-down list, so we must create a dynamic element method as well to populate this list.

===== Button Dialog

We create a simple button dialog with a dynamic drop-down element named **service** (see <<i10>>).

[[i10]]
.Button Dialog
image::images/ss10.png[Screenshot,600,align="center"]
{zwsp} +

===== Dialog element method

The dynamic drop-down element in the service dialog calls a method called _list_services_. We only wish to display a service in the drop-down list if the user has permissions to see it via their tenant membership and role-based access control (RBAC) filter. We define three methods; `get_visible_tenant_ids` to get our tenant and any child tenant IDs; `get_current_group_rbac_array` to retrieve a user's RBAC filter array, and `service_visible?` to check that a service has a tag that matches the filter. The code for CloudForms 4.1/ManageIQ _Darga_ is as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
def get_visible_tenant_ids
  tenant_ancestry = []
  tenant_ancestry << $evm.root['tenant'].id
  $evm.vmdb(:tenant).all.each do |tenant|
    unless tenant.ancestry.nil?
      ancestors = tenant.ancestry.split('/')
      if ancestors.include?($evm.root['tenant'].id.to_s)
        tenant_ancestry << tenant.id
      end
    end
  end
  tenant_ancestry
end

def get_current_group_rbac_array(rbac_array=[])
  user = $evm.root['user']
  unless user.current_group.filters.blank?
    user.current_group.filters['managed'].flatten.each do |filter|
      next unless /(?<category>\w*)\/(?<tag>\w*)$/i =~ filter
      rbac_array << {category => tag}
    end
  end
  rbac_array
end
   
def service_visible?(visible_tenants, rbac_array, service)
  visible = false
  $evm.log(:info, "Evaluating Service #{service.name}")
  if visible_tenants.include?(service.tenant.id)
    if rbac_array.length.zero?
      visible = true
    else
      rbac_array.each do |rbac_hash|
        rbac_hash.each do |category, tag|
          if service.tagged_with?(category, tag)
            visible = true
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
  visible
end
----

The method of implementing RBAC filters changed slightly with CloudForms 4.2/ManageIQ _Euwe_. For this release and later we must change the __get_current_group_rbac_array__ to the following code:

[source,ruby]
----
#
# Code to be included once tested
----

When we enumerate the services, we check on visibility to the user before adding to the drop-down list:

[source,ruby]
----
rbac_array       = get_current_group_rbac_array
visible_tenants  = get_visible_tenant_ids
values_hash      = {}
visible_services = []
  
$evm.vmdb(:service).all.each do |service|
  if service['display']
    if service_visible?(visible_tenants, rbac_array, service)
      visible_services << service
    end
  end
end
if visible_services.length > 0
  if visible_services.length > 1
    values_hash['!'] = '-- select from list --'
  end
  visible_services.each do |service|
    values_hash[service.id] = service.name
  end
else
  values_hash['!'] = 'No services are available'
end
----

Here we use a simple technique of keeping the string "-- select from list --" at the top of the list, by using a key string of "!" which is the first ASCII printable nonwhitespace character.

[[button-method]]
===== Button method

The main instance and method called from the button are each called _add_to_service_. This method adds the current virtual machine or service, into the service selected from the drop-down list. As we wish to be able to call this from a button on either a _Service_ object type or a _VM and instance_ object type, we identify our context using `$evm.root['vmdb_object_type']`.

If we are adding a virtual machine to an existing service, we should allow for the fact that the virtual machine might itself have been provisioned from a service. We detect any existing service membership, and if the old service is empty after we move the virtual machine, we delete the service from the VMDB:

[source,ruby]
----
begin
  new_service_id = $evm.root['dialog_service']
  new_service = $evm.vmdb('service', new_service_id) rescue nil
  if new_service.nil?
    $evm.log(:error, "Can't find service with ID: #{new_service_id}")
    exit MIQ_ERROR
  else
    case $evm.root['vmdb_object_type']
    when 'service'
      $evm.log(:info, "Adding Service #{$evm.root['service'].name} to #{new_service.name}")
      $evm.root['service'].new_service = new_service
    when 'vm'
      vm = $evm.root['vm']
      #
      # See if the VM is already part of a service
      #
      unless vm.service.nil?
        old_service = vm.service
        vm.remove_from_service
        if old_service.v_total_vms.zero?
          $evm.log(:info, "Old service #{old_service.name} is now empty, removing it from VMDB")
          old_service.remove_from_vmdb
        end
      end
      $evm.log(:info, "Adding VM #{vm.name} to #{new_service.name}")
      vm.add_to_service(new_service)
      #
      # Set the VM's owner and group to be the same as the new service
      #
      unless new_service.evm_owner_id.nil?
        vm.owner = $evm.vmdb(:user).find_by_id(new_service.evm_owner_id)
      end
      unless new_service.miq_group_id.nil?
        vm.group = $evm.vmdb(:miq_group).find_by_id(new_service.miq_group_id)
      end
    end
  end
  exit MIQ_OK
rescue => err
  $evm.log(:error, "[#{err}]\n#{err.backtrace.join("\n")}")
  exit MIQ_ERROR
end
----

The scripts in this chapter are available link:scripts[here]

===== Putting it all together

Finally we create two *Add to Service* buttons, one on a _Service_ object type, and one on a _VM and Instance_ object type. We can go ahead and organise our service hierarchies.

[NOTE]
====
__Exercise__

Filter the list of services presented in the drop-down to remove the _current_ service - we would never wish to add a service as its own parent.
====

=== Summary

Organising our services in this way changes the way that we think about our cloud or virtual infrastructure. We start to think in terms of service workloads, rather than individual virtual machines or instances. We can start to work in a more "cloudy" way, where we treat our virtual machines as anonymous entities, and scale out or scale back according to point-in-time application demand.

We can also use service bundles and hierachies of bundles to keep track of the resources in projects and subprojects. This can help from an organisational point of view, for example we can tag services, and our method to add a virtual machine to a service can propagate any service tags to the virtual machine. In this way we can assign project-related chargeback costs to the tagged VMs, or apply WebUI display filters that display project resources.
